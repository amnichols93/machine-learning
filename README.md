# Module 17

This module challenge asked us to run six different machine learning modules on a set of credit risk data to determine a reliable model for predicting high risk files. Between the six models, I ultimately determined that none of them were accurate/reliable enough to proceed with and different models would need to be pursued. Further analysis is at the end of each Jupyter Notebook, per my understanding of the challenge instructions.
